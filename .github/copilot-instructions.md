# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This repository’s coding standards and conventions are defined in `agents.md` at the repository root.

When generating or modifying code, GitHub Copilot should:

1. **Read and follow all rules in `AGENTS.md`.**
2. Prefer patterns and APIs that match the existing codebase.
3. When in doubt, choose clarity over cleverness and stay consistent with `AGENTS.md`.
